# HW6-WeatherDash

## What was the expected outcome for this homework?

The main purpose of this project was to create a weather app. This app had to display the current weather for a specific city and 5 day forecast span. It had to display previous searched cities so that a user could click on them and search for them again. Those cities would be also saved onto local storage so that it would stay on the page even after refresh.

## What skills were used in this project?
* HTML
* CSS 
* jQuery
* Local Storage
* Bootstrap
* AJAX calls
* Third Party API (openweather)
  
### Main takeway and obstacles encountered.
The main takeaway from the project was the implementation of third-party-apis and thier use in our app. Also, the next big takeaway on a personal level was the understanding of using local storage in the app to save input values. However, local storage continues to be my major issue of not being able to retrive successfully how I need to do.
